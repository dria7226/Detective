- implement task system and finish occlussion system
	- finish arranging the scene
	- decide what the occlusion tree will look like
		-
	- create one occlusion group with all the objects in it
	- create multiple occlusion groups
	- implement task system data structure (ds_list of task objects, each object has two ds_lists, one for variables other for scripts)
	- rewrite load_intro into separate, reusable scripts
	- rewrite load_intro as sub-task ds_list
- implement occlusion generation as part of load_intro
