- if start of boolean group and mode is complete
	- draw front and back of B
	- set boolean mode

- draw front A

- if end of boolean group and carving out
	- carve out each B
	- clear boolean mode

- review code
	- add code tags
		- based on data structure
			- uses_identities
			- uses_tags
			- uses_uniform_buffer
			- uses_normal_compression
			- uses_[object_tag]
		- based on data usage
			- uses_object_tags
			- uses_back_reffered_tags
- implement task system and finish occlusion system
	- finish arranging the scene
	- decide what the occlusion tree will look like
		-
	- create one occlusion group with all the objects in it
	- create multiple occlusion groups
	- implement task system data structure (ds_list of task objects, each object has two ds_lists, one for variables other for scripts)
	- rewrite load_intro into separate, reusable scripts
	- rewrite load_intro as sub-task ds_list
	-
- add timestamp to log() script

  Level Generator w/ Designer AI-----ETA
	-make helper scripts for level generation (mirror, union, difference,... like openjscad)
  	-task system
	  -spatial hierarchy (contains locations, content groups and objects) (locations can contain content groups and objects, content groups can contain objects)
