 - rewrite occlusion debug using camera_offset
- modify standard shader to include texture capability (needs testing)
- implement task system and finish occlussion system
	- implement occlusion in shader
	- finish arranging the scene
	- decide what the occlusion tree will look like
		- 
	- create one occlusion group with all the objects in it
	- create multiple occlusion grroups
	- implement task system data structure (ds_list of task objects, each object has two ds_lists, one for variables other for scripts)
	- rewrite load_intro into separate, reusable scripts
	- rewrite load_intro as sub-task ds_list
- implement occlusion generation as part of load_intro
	-  
- implement back-referenced tags
- create_identity() with tag reference OR new tag (add another argument: an array of reffered tag indices, -1 meaning to create a new tag)
