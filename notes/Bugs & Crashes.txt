Crashes
- nonexisting segment at end of path (upon reaching end of path) get_point_on_path()

Bugs
- Depth buffer encoding in standard shader
- switch unnecessary for loops to while loops
- switch from to_draw list to Visible tag system (also figure out how to include identity information in occlusion_groups)
	- switch "Game.tags" from array to ds_list of ds_lists
