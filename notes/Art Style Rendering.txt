"Mad Men"

- pale color wide strokes used on Don's hand are used to show skin folds.
	Implementation:
	Might be possible to simulate this by using light, mesh color and cartoon shader.

- thin zigzag on Don's temple used to show rare hair and direction of hair.
	Implementation?

- darker reds on Joan used to show lighting
	Implementation:
	Obviously use light, mesh color, cartoon shader

- smoke created through negative space. Works well with dark, non-lit backgrounds.
	Implementation:
	Three different color buffers: black, gray and color; displacement map applied on the gray buffer.
	Gray buffer generated from black buffer and other gray sources

- daylight smoke?
	Implementation?

- contour lines on Joan are used to separate her from the light background. It is needed due to her light colored skin.
	Implementation: ?
	Need a rule that applies across all cases of color matching meshes in different z planes.
	Could be random frame to frame?

	Generate edge map, generate mask from final color buffer and depth map to determine same colors.
	Apply mask on edge map.
	Randomness could be determined through a noise map.

	Note: Contour lines not present between Don and the couch. Why?

- brush bleed in between objects (necessary for handpainted authenticity)
	Implementation?
	Refer to smoke implementation.

- brush texture is a result of the texture of the paper
	Implementation:
	paper-texture height map with blend value texture. (similar to burning paper effect)

- some brush textures are a result of the brush itself. (grass like textures)
	Implementation?

"Joan and Frank"

- classic dotted shading technique used for early comic books.
	Implementation:
	Mask generated from shadow buffer, used over a dotted texture
